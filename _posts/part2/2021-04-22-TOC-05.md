## Code Manual

question-9-1: implement two new callbacks
1) Recorder: records scheduled learning rate & plot
2) ParamScheduler: schedule any hyperparameter (as long as itâ€™s registered in the state_dict of optimizer)
- hint. consider when to save parameters
- hint. self - learn object

/question-9-2: implement annealer decorator and cosine scheduler
	- Linear, Cosine, Exponential

question: plot above annealers start from 2 end with 0.01 (you'd need monkey patch code)

question: implement combine scheduler and test it with
- changes the learning rate (0.3, 0.7) at 0% ~ 35% of training and (0.7, 0.01) of learning rate to the left process.
	- feed this function to Recorder / ParamScheduler callback and plot loss / lr
